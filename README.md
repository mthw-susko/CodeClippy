# CodeClippy Web Application
This is a application that takes advantage of a custom trained LLAMA model for python code completion. 

To run the application, run the app.py file then run `npm start` to start the frontend.

You will additionally need to install and put the .gguf model file in the source directory of this project separately as it is too large to put on github (~30gb). 

I can send it out on request :).

have fun!

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Misc
Included is also the python script train our model that is used for this application.
